\section*{Background}
\subsection*{Current State of Cloud Computing For Bioinformatics}
Here we do a review of applications of cloud computing to bioinformatics. Everything from CloudMan, Galaxy, CloVR, Qiime, CBL etc. \pb

\subsection*{Open-Source Cloud Computing PlatForms and Private Clouds} 

\subsubsection*{Eucalyptus}
Ntino and Alex. Describe the Eucalyptus architecture and components (Walrus, EBS etc) that it provides. 
Example private cloud installations that use it. \pb


\subsubsection*{OpenStack}
Enis and collaborators. Describe the OpenStack architecture and components (Nova, S3 etc) that it provides.
Example private cloud installations that use it. \pb

\section*{Results and Discussion}


\subsection*{Porting the CloudBioLinux-CloudMan Framework to Private Clouds} 

\subsubsection*{The CloudMan Implementation For Scalable Computing on The Cloud}
Enis, technical description of CloudMan as it stands for Amazon EC2. For example it uses two data volumes,
pulls the code on boot from S3, how does it work with snapshots etc. This will serve as leeway for when describing
how we mapped these components to the other platforms, see below. \pb

\subsubsection*{Porting CloudBioLinux-CloudMan to Eucalyptus}
Alex, technical description of changes to the CloudMan EC2 codebase to run on Eucalyptus. How components that
CloudMan uses on EC2 where mapped to Eucalyptus. Specific nagging that Eucalyptus does with running CloudMan -
i.e. different responses from the API returned when doing calls via boto, and changes in the cloudman codebase in
order to take care of these. Also is there something that sysadmins that set up Eucalyptus should pay attention too 
(in the settings, in order to leverage those applications that create scriptable infrastructures by calling the API) \pb

\subsubsection*{Porting CloudBioLinux-CloudMan to OpenStack}
Enis, technical description of changes to the CloudMan EC2 codebase to run on OpenStack.  Changes that have be
made to code in order to communicate with the API correctly. What sysadmins that set up OpenStack should pay attention 
too... \pb

\subsubsection*{Porting CloudBioLinux-CloudMan to VirtualBox for Desktop Computers}
Ntino's adventures in the hacker-land... \pb

\subsection*{Execution and Performance of Bioinformatic Pipelines on Private Clouds} 

\subsubsection*{An HMM-BLAST Pipeline for Metagenomic Annotation at JCVI}
Ntino... I got the numbers, need to write it. \pb

\subsubsection*{A Variant Calling Analysis Pipeline at HSPH}
Brad... Wanna write about this historic pipeline, or save it for another paper ? Up to use.\pb

\subsubsection*{Enis Other Example of Pipeline}
Enis... Some bioinformatics pipelines run with the other Foster drinkers down under....\pb

\section*{Conclusions} We conclude that we are freaking awesome ! \ldots
